# Back-End environment requirements:
* Node.js >= 16.10
* Latest stable version of yarn 1

## Installation:
1. It's recommended to have nvm installed, so you can quickly change nodejs versions on your environment.

    Depending on your OS there is two links that can guide you with installation:

   *    **Unix based**: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm 

   *    **Windows**: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

    

2. After successfully setting up nvm:

    ```
            nvm install lts && nvm use lts
    ```        

3. One of simplies method to get the latest stable version of yarn 1 is:

    ```
     npm install --global yarn
    ```

4. Simply run:

    ```
        yarn or yarn install
    ```

    inside of the root folder in the project to get all of the necessary dependencies.

5. Npm scripts like: 

    ```
    yarn start
    ```

    should be working as usual from here.
